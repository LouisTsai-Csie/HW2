GitHub Workflow Assignment Report

For this assignment, I followed the instructions to set up a complete GitHub workflow, including repo setup, issue handling, pull requests, and GitHub Actions integration.

## Repository Setup
- Created a public GitHub repository to ensure visibility for the instructor.
- Prepared a README.md file with meaningful content and made sure it was not just a default template.
- Created two additional branches: hw1-p and hw1-f, in addition to the main branch, as required.

## Issue and Template
- Opened a test issue to simulate a real bug report or request.
- Configured and enabled an Issue Template, which allows users to report bugs using a pre-defined structure.

## Pull Requests
- Created two pull requests: one from hw1-p and one from hw1-f, both targeting the main branch.
- Made sure that both PRs included file changes.
- Added comments to the PRs to simulate interaction and explain the code changes.

## GitHub Actions
- Enabled GitHub Actions in the repository and added a custom CI workflow.
- Ensured that the workflow contains at least two explicit steps beyond the default setup/post (e.g., install dependencies, run tests).
- For the hw1-p branch: GitHub Action runs successfully.
- For the hw1-f branch: intentionally introduced a failure in the code to make the workflow fail when testing this PR, as required.
